    "# Contact Invariant Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook gives an overview of [Contact Invariant Optimization](<https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~todorov/papers/MordatchSCA12.pdf>) (CIO) and an implementation of the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for manipulation trajectories involving contact is a notoriously difficult optimization problem due to discontinuities introduced by the hybrid space. CIO attempts to solve this issue by smoothing the transitions between contact dynamics and free space dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "CIO tries to solve the problem of finding a trajectory which manipulates an object into a desired state. The basis of CIO is the objective function which constrains the desired motion of the manipulated object and the manipulator. CIO attempts to solve for the necessary places to make contact, the forces to apply at these contact points, and the trajectory of the manipulated object and fingers. The paper describes all of the constraints used in the final optimization (L-BFGS). Here is a video of the kinds of manipulation plans CIO is able to find."

To calculate this we introduce new variables, $\\pi_O(r_j)$ and $\\pi_j(r_j)$. $\\pi_O(r_j)$ is $r_j$ projected onto finger $j$. $\\pi_j(r_j)$ is $r_j$ projected onto the manipulated object.
